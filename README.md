Today's the day I start a github. I've been reading so much about Sim Racing, I've been in the multiple discords, I've watched hours upon
hours of youtube videos, so I guess it's finally time to begin. During my current situation, I'm a college student studying Computer 
Science, however programming isn't scratching my itch. I much prefer 3d Modeling, so I plan on using this hobby to hone my skills. Feel 
free to add some comments, and do not hesitate to give me feedback as I release updates and type little articles about projects. This is
more for my personal growth, but an outside source will surely help me grow.
